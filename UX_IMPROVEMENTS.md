## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES** (Fix Immediately)

### ❌ **Issue #1: JavaScript Functionality Broken**
- **Status**: 🔴 Critical
- **Problem**: `showModal is not defined` error prevents all interactive features
- **Impact**: Users cannot access detailed information about experience, skills, or projects
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript parsing errors, likely from emoji characters in template literals
- **Solution**: Debug JavaScript, remove problematic characters, test modal system
- **Priority**: P0 - Blocks core functionality

### ❌ **Issue #2: Loading Screen Stuck**  
- **Status**: 🔴 Critical
- **Problem**: Loading screen displays indefinitely, blocking content access
- **Impact**: Users only see "JAKEFLIX" logo, cannot access resume content

### ❌ **Issue #3: Content Cards Empty**
- **Status**: 🔴 Critical  
- **Problem**: Beautiful gradient cards show no titles, descriptions, or content
